                    <h2 class=mHeaders>Trial Beginnings</h2>
                    <p class=mainArticle>   The trial that was held in Strattenburg, Pennsylvania of Pete Duffy began with the introduction of both
                        the prosecutor and the defense. Pete Duffy had been accused of killing his wife and creating a cover up by stealing 
                        jewlery and handguns. The prosecutor, Jack Hogan, started his prosecution by introducing the victim's name, Myra Duffy
                        and age, forty-six years, and describing the crime. His opening statement included his idea on how the crime was comitted.
                        According to Mr. Hogan, the defendant played golf, something he partook in frequently, at 11:10 am as shown in the computer
                        log. Pete Duffy then left the course intruding his own home, killing his wife and disguising the death as a robbery
                        to gather the one million dollar insurance plan for Mrs. Duffy. Mr. Duffy required this money due to the debts he owed 
                        to the banks as he dabbled in Real Estate. The defense, Clifford Nance, began stating that Pete Duffy would testify though he was not forced to do so,
                        and turned many arguments against the prosecution by proving that all they had were maybes.

                        safe from Hogan and his gang. - Clifford Nance

                    <h2 class=mHeaders>The Kid Lawyer</h2>
                    <p class=mainArticle>   As the trial continued, Theo Boone, son of Marcella Boone and Woods Boone, continued his life 
                        as a child dreaming to partake in the court of law which is no surprise as Theo's parents are both lawyers. 
                        On a particular morning, Theo encountered a friend of his who appears very interested in the case.
                        Julio, Theo's friend, would soon be known to know more about the case, but the things he knew were not something he had seen himself.
                        Julio's brother spotted Peter Duffy drive a golf kart back to his house at the time of the murder and leave while 
                        Julio's brother was enjoying his lunch break at the golf course. Theo would soon meet the brother in promised confidence and come to find that the brother was an 
                        illegal immigrant, and that the brother was able to find the glove that was used to kill Myra Duffy. 
                        Due to him being an illegal immigrant, testifying was almost impossible. If the brother testified, he would certainly be deported.
                        Theo had to create a plan, one that would allow the immunity of the brother while also proving guilt. Although Theo 
                        could not do this alone, he needed his family's help, but that would mean breaking the brother's trust. Still, Theo 
                        followed through and told his family everything. What was the conclusion they came to? They decided that the best 
                        course was to promise the brother and his family a house as they had been living in a homeless shelter with the gamble that they may be deported. This promise 
                        weighed on the choice of testifying or not testifying, and the brother chose to testify.

                    <h2 class=mHeaders>The Shocked Duffy</h2>
                    <p class=mainArticle>   For what had seemed like a year, the trial was coming to a close. The prosecution
                        had no real evidence to use against the defendants, but one man named Bobby Escobar, Julio's brother, could
                        entirely change the outcome of the trial. Before the final day of the trial, Henry Gantry, the judge, had met with 
                        Theo Boone and his family to discuss the evidence that they may be able to provide to prove Mr. Duffy's guilt. Theo, 
                        his family and Henry Gantry talked of what to do with the evidence they had obtained. In the evening of the next day, 
                        the doors to the court house opened and Judge Gantry began and ended court all at the same time.

                    <p class=quotes>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. At this point in the trial of Mr. Peter Duffy, we are scheduled to hear
                        the closing arguments from the lawyers. However, this will not happen. For reasons I will not explain at this moment,
                        I am declaring a mistrial. - Henry Gantry
